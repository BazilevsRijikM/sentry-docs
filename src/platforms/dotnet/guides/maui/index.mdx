Sentry has an integration for the [.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui) through the [Sentry.Maui NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui).

## Overview of the features

- Easy MAUI integration by calling `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`
- All the features of our main [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet), for your managed code
- Native crash reporting for Android, leveraging our [Android SDK](/platforms/android)
- Managed crash reporting (unhandled exceptions), on any MAUI platform
- Automatic breadcrumbs for MAUI app lifecycle and UI events
- Detailed device and runtime information passed on every event
- ... more coming soon!

## Installation

Add the Sentry dependency to your .NET MAUI application:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Maui -Version 3.18.0-preview.1
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Maui -v 3.18.0-preview.1
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that besides the MAUI related features, through this package you'll also get access to all the framework's logging integration and also the features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

<Note>

#### Troubleshooting

The MAUI workloads are updated by Microsoft periodically. When trying to install or update `Sentry.Maui`, you may get errors such as the following:

```
error: NU1605: Detected package downgrade: Microsoft.Maui.Dependencies from 6.0.400 to 6.0.312. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.
error:  test -> Sentry.Maui 3.18.0-preview.1 -> Microsoft.Maui.Dependencies (>= 6.0.400)
error:  test -> Microsoft.Maui.Dependencies (>= 6.0.312)
```

This happens when you have an older version of the `maui` workload than the one that was current when we built the package.
This problem will be fixed in the next release.  For now, you can update your workloads by using the `dotnet workload update` command.  See [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/1724) for further details.

</Note>

### Configure

In your `MauiProgram.cs` file, call `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`, and include any options you would like to set.  The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.

For example:

```csharp
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp() =>
    MauiApp.CreateBuilder()
        .UseMauiApp<App>()
        .UseSentry(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        })
        // The remainder of your configuration
        .Build();
}
```
