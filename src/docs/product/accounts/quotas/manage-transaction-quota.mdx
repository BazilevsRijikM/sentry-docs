In most cases, sending all [transaction](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#what-is-a-transaction) events to Sentry would generate more performance data than you might find useful and might use up your transactions quota too quickly. Sentry provides tools to control the _type_ and _amount_ of transactions that are monitored. This allows you to have transaction data that's actionable and meaningful, and to manage your quota. Applying the proper SDK configuration is an iterative and on-going process, but these tips will show you how to best use Sentry's tools to get the most out of your transaction events.

## 1. SDK Configuration: Tracing Options {#2-sdk-configuration-tracing-options}

When you configure your the SDK, you can control the number of transactions that are sent to Sentry by setting the [tracing options](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/options/%23tracing-options). You can also set up [custom instrumentation](/platform-redirect/?next=/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/) for performance monitoring to capture certain types of transactions.

## 2. Inbound Data Filters

While SDK configuration requires changes to your source code and depends on your next deployment, server-side filters can be easily configured per project in the "Data Filters" section of **[Project] > Settings > Inbound Filters**. Learn more in [Inbound Filters](/product/accounts/quotas/#inbound-data-filters).

Once applied, you can track the filtered events (numbers and cause) using the graph provided at the top of the "Inbound Filters" page.

## 3. Event Usage Stats

Once you've completed the steps above, you can look at your events in aggregate in the "Usage Stats" tab of **Stats**. This information will help you answer key questions about the breakdown of your incoming events or which projects are consuming your quota. The answers to these questions can help you figure out where you need to do further fine-tuning of your SDK configuration.
