Setting up releases fully is a multi-step process, and is adaptable to your organization's needs.

If you're using one of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options, it will x (EXPLAIN THIS FURTHER). Then you just need to coplete the SDK configuration and the rest of the steps are completed for you. If you're doing this manually, then you should follow the steps below.

## Configure Your SDK

With your [SDK configured](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) to provide a release identifer and enable session tracking, you can monitor both [releases](/product/releases/) and [release health](/product/releases/health/).

<Note>

You must have the environment [configured in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/environments/) to use this feature.

</Note>

### Release Health

Release health is supported for the following SDKs:

- [Android](/platforms/android/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Flutter](/platforms/flutter/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [iOS](/platforms/apple/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Native (C/C++)](/platforms/native/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Python](/platforms/python/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [React Native](/platforms/react-native/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Rust](/platforms/rust/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [.NET](/platforms/dotnet/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Unity](/platforms/unity/configuration/releases/#release-health)

## Upload Source Maps

Releases are required to apply source maps, which lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6). In turn, source maps are required in order to enable [suspect commits](#enable-suspect-commits).

## Enable Suspect Commits

With an additional repository integration or manual commits, you can also track suspect commits.

1. [Installing a repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) (this step is optional, but highly recommended)
2. [Associating commits to a release](/product/releases/suspect-commits/) by adding to your release management script when you build a release.

## Notify Sentry

If you're not using on of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options, let Sentry know youâ€™ve deployed by sending an additional request after creating a release:

```bash
sentry-cli releases --org ORGANIZATION_SLUG deploys VERSION new -e ENVIRONMENT
```

NOTE: Make sure you have a [token](/product/cli/configuration/) properly configured.

You can also use our [API](/api/releases/create-a-new-deploy-for-an-organization/) to create a deploy.

When you notify Sentry that you've deployed a release to a new environment, we can automatically send an email to Sentry users who have committed to the release being deployed.
