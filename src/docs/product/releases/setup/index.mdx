Setting up your application to send Sentry releases data fully is a multi-step process, and is adaptable to your organization's needs.

If you're using one of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options, it will automate the last two steps of this process. You just need to ensure that the SDK is configured and that you've uploaded source maps. If you're managing your releases manually, then you should follow all of the steps below.

## 1. Configure Your SDK {#configure-your-sdk}

With your SDK configured to provide a release identifer and enable session tracking, you can monitor both [releases](/product/releases/) and [release health](/product/releases/health/). Check out the documentation for your specific platform to [configure the SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/).

<Note>

You must have the environment [configured in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/environments/) to use this feature.

</Note>

### Release Health

Release health is supported for the following SDKs:

- [Android](/platforms/android/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Flutter](/platforms/flutter/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [iOS](/platforms/apple/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Native (C/C++)](/platforms/native/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Python](/platforms/python/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [React Native](/platforms/react-native/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Rust](/platforms/rust/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [.NET](/platforms/dotnet/configuration/releases/#release-health)
- [Unity](/platforms/unity/configuration/releases/#release-health)

## 2. Upload Source Maps

Releases are required to apply source maps (or your platform-specific files for mapping), which let you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6). In turn, source maps are required in order to enable [suspect commits](#3-enable-suspect-commits). Check out our SDK documentation to find source maps-type information for your specific platform if it's not in the list below:

- [Android](/platforms/android/using-ndk/#symbolicate-stack-traces)
- [Flutter](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/)
- [iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/)
- [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/)
- [Node.js](/platforms/node/sourcemaps/)

## 3. Enable Suspect Commits

With an additional repository integration enabled or manual commits, you can also track suspect commits. This is a two-step process:

1. [Installing a repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) (this step is optional, but highly recommended)
2. [Associating commits to a release](/product/releases/suspect-commits/) by adding to your release management script when you build a release.

Learn more about the benefits of tracking commits in [Suspect Commits](/product/releases/suspect-commits/).

## 4. Notify Sentry {#notify-sentry}

If you're not using one of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options, let Sentry know youâ€™ve deployed by sending an additional request after creating a release:

```bash
sentry-cli releases --org ORGANIZATION_SLUG deploys VERSION new -e ENVIRONMENT
```

<Note>

Make sure you have a [token](/product/cli/configuration/) properly configured.

</Note>

You can also use our [API](/api/releases/create-a-new-deploy-for-an-organization/) to create a deploy.

When you notify Sentry that you've deployed a release to a new environment, we can automatically send an email to Sentry users who have committed to the release being deployed.
